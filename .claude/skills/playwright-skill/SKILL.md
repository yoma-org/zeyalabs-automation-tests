# Playwright Skill

## Purpose

Implement approved test cases with a maintainable Playwright TypeScript framework, for
every app in this repository.

This skill also supports:

- creating the Playwright framework from scratch;
- reviewing an existing Playwright repository;
- targeted Website Discovery;
- planning automation from canonical test cases;
- implementing UI and API automation;
- reviewing, refactoring, debugging, healing, and reporting.

## Repository Layout (multi-project)

```text
projects/<app>/            one folder per application under test (farewell, spark, dashboard, …)
  PROJECT.md               app rules: system under test, roles, data, safety (read first)
  docs/test-cases/         canonical test cases (source of truth) + generated catalog
  docs/…                   app knowledge base
  src/  tests/  specs/     Page Objects / fixtures / API clients, specs, Planner plans
  playwright.config.ts     app config (own .env, baseURL, auth, reports)
  tsconfig.json            aliases (@pages, @fixtures, …) → this app's src/, @shared → shared/
  test-cases.config.mjs    README feature groups for cases:build
projects/_template/        scaffold copied by `npm run new-project -- <name>`
shared/                    code used by two or more apps (@shared/*)
playwright.config.ts       picks projects/$APP/playwright.config.ts
```

**First, identify the app** the task is about (from the request, the case ID prefix, or
the files involved; ask if it is ambiguous). In this skill, paths such as `docs/test-cases/`,
`src/`, `tests/` and `specs/` mean `projects/<app>/…`.

**Then always read `projects/<app>/PROJECT.md`.** It holds the app-specific rules (system
under test, roles, API quirks, data isolation, safety) that override the generic examples
in the references. Many examples in the references come from **EM** (Estate Management, a
project kept in the separate `em-automation-tests` repo): maker–checker roles, encrypted
responses, apartments, MMK, IDs such as `INV-017`. Treat them as illustrations, not as rules
for the apps here.

Generic test-case → test conventions (titles, annotations, tags, variants, `@review`, CI
gates) are in `references/test-case-conventions.md` and apply to every app.

Commands take the app: `APP=<app> npx playwright test` (or `-c projects/<app>`),
`npm run cases:build -- --app <app>`, `npm run traceability -- --app <app>`.

## Canonical Test Cases

- Source of truth: the case sections in `docs/test-cases/features/**/*.md`. `docs/test-cases/test-catalog.csv`,
  the suites and the summary tables are generated from them by `npm run cases:build -- --app <app>`.
- Cross-module flows: `docs/test-cases/suites/e2e-critical-flows.md` (`E2E-01`, `E2E-02`, …).
- IDs are `<FEATURE>-<nnn>` (e.g. `AUTH-001`, `INV-017`, `OB-SOA-007`). Keep the source ID
  (e.g. `TC_Login_001`) for traceability.
- Business context: the knowledge docs `PROJECT.md` points to (usually `docs/knowledge/`).

Status mapping:

| Status | Action |
|---|---|
| `Active` | Implement. |
| `Review` | Implement as the case states it, tag `@review`, annotate the open question (`status_note`). Use `test.fixme()` only when there is no usable expected result. Never invent one. |
| `Obsolete` | Do not implement. |
| Automation `Manual` | Do not implement; list it as manual-only in the report. |

## Preconditions

Before executing a Playwright task, determine:

- requested scope (IDs, feature, suite);
- whether the framework pieces it needs already exist;
- the app (`projects/<app>/`) and its `PROJECT.md`;
- environment and base URLs (web, APIs) — never production;
- roles and credentials needed;
- test-data strategy (what each test or flow creates for itself);
- permitted and forbidden discovery actions.

Do not claim setup or validation succeeded unless the commands were executed successfully.

## Global Rules

1. Inspect the repository before creating or moving files.
2. For a new setup, follow `references/project-setup-architecture.md`.
3. Preserve valid existing conventions unless restructuring is explicitly requested.
4. Implement only `Active` and `Review` canonical cases, as the Status mapping says; never `Obsolete` or `Manual`.
5. `docs/test-cases/` remains the single source of truth; the Planner never owns a separate case set.
6. Validated gaps are written back to the feature file in `docs/test-cases/` and the catalog rebuilt
   (`npm run cases:build -- --app <app>`), not kept only in `specs/`.
7. Use fixtures for dependency injection and lifecycle management.
8. Keep locators and reusable page interactions in Page or Component Objects.
9. Keep scenario-specific business assertions visible in specs.
10. Prefer API setup when it is more reliable than UI setup.
11. Use Playwright web-first assertions and locator auto-waiting.
12. Do not use `page.waitForTimeout()` for synchronization.
13. Do not hide flakiness with retries.
14. Never perform unsafe Website Discovery actions.
15. One merged case with Data variants = one parameterized test, one run per variant.
    The catalog has one `canonical` row per case and one `variant` row per extra variant;
    plan by canonical row, never one test case per catalog row.
16. Every implemented case has its own test in `tests/<feature>/`, whether or not an E2E flow
    also covers it.
17. Before reporting, run `node .claude/skills/playwright-skill/scripts/check-traceability.mjs --app <app>`
    and fix what it reports.
18. Keep apps apart: an app never imports from another app's `src/`. Code two apps need moves
    to `shared/`.

## Playwright Agents

The repo has `.claude/agents/playwright-test-planner.md`, `-generator.md`, `-healer.md`
and the `playwright-test` MCP server. The MCP server serves one app at a time, chosen by
`APP` when Claude Code starts (`.mcp.json` defaults it to `farewell`); to work on another app,
restart with `APP=<app>`. Use the agents within this skill's architecture:

- **Planner** explores the app and saves plans to `specs/`. A plan must reference canonical
  IDs; anything new is a `GAP-*` until validated (see `references/planner.md`).
- **Generator** records a working flow and writes a raw spec under `tests/_drafts/`.
  Treat its output as a **draft**: move locators into Page/Component Objects, switch
  imports to `@fixtures`, add tags and the `tc` / `source` annotations, then delete the draft.
- **Healer** fixes failing tests. Its fixes must land in the Page Object, not as inline
  locators in specs, and must follow `references/debugging-healing.md`.
- `projects/<app>/tests/seed.spec.ts` is the agents' starting point. Once the framework is set up it
  imports from `@fixtures` and starts authenticated (`templates/seed.spec.ts`); check the
  repo, because until then it is the empty generated file.
- Each agent file starts with a **"Project rules"** block that points it to this skill and
  the app's `PROJECT.md`.
  `npx playwright init-agents` overwrites the agent files: after running it, restore the
  blocks from `references/agent-overrides.md`.

- `references/reporting.md`

## New App Workflow

1. `npm run new-project -- <name>` (copies `projects/_template/`, builds its catalog).
2. Fill in `projects/<name>/PROJECT.md` with the team's answers; mark guesses **unconfirmed**.
3. Import or write the test cases in `projects/<name>/docs/test-cases/features/`, set groups
   in `test-cases.config.mjs`, run `npm run cases:build -- --app <name>`.
4. Continue with the Setup Workflow below, inside `projects/<name>/`.

## Setup Workflow

1. Inspect repository and application technology.
2. Detect package manager.
3. Check whether Playwright already exists (it does: `@playwright/test` is installed).
4. Initialize Playwright only when absent.
5. Create the expected structure.
6. Configure TypeScript, Playwright, linting, formatting, environment, aliases, and npm scripts.
7. Add minimal Page Object, Component, API client, fixtures, and example test.
8. Add role-based authentication setup.
9. Run validation, including `scripts/check-traceability.mjs --app <app>`.
10. Report files created, commands executed, failures, and remaining manual steps.

## Automation Workflow

```text
Active / Review case IDs (canonical rows; variants come with their case)
→ Planner review (+ optional discovery)
→ Gap classification
→ Canonical artifact update
→ Implementation plan
→ Generator (draft) → refactor into POM / fixtures
→ Reviewer
→ Targeted healing
→ Reporting
```

## Required Completion Summary

Report:

- the app;
- files created or modified;
- test case IDs implemented (and those tagged `@review`, left as `fixme`, or manual);
- commands executed;
- validation results;
- blockers;
- remaining manual work.
